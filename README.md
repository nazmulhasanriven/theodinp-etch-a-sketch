# Etch A Sketch Project
This is a simple Etch-A-Sketch project. I've created it as an assignment by the odinproject.

To use this place your mouse over the board. Single click to enable draw mode. Click again to disable it. Click the rainbow button to draw with a random color. Click on the clear button to erase the board.
You can select size of the Sketchpad by clicking the Select button and then provide a number between 2 - 100.
